# Data-Visualization-Hackathon-Uline-company
Analyzed the Uline company’s real time data(1M+ records) on the delivery centers using R studio and SparklyR. Transformed the raw data using filters from dplyr visualizing the delivery centers and customer locations using geocoding library and grouped the data into different clusters which improved analysis run time.
Created visualization and dashboards in Rstudio for the analyzed Uline real time data.
Based on analysis and dashboards, came up with new location for data center which could lower their delivery latency and improve Uline’s business.
